        <p>Hi! My name is Clint Gordy and I like to do a lot of wierd things. From gaming to
            sim racing to hockey, I like to stay busy and make sure life is always interesting.
        </p>

        <p>If you asked me three years ago what I were to do today, I wouldn't have told you
            software development. But life has a certain way of throwing very fun things at
            you and here I am, and here's my porfolio :)
        </p>

        <p>I was born and raised in Southern California in a small town called Rancho Cucamonga.
            If you've heard of it in spaces beyond the popular TV show Workaholics, I would be
            very surprised. For college, I went to school at the University of California, Santa
            Barbara, where I studied Global and International Studies. Haven't really done much Workaholics
            related to that, but hey, that's life.
        </p>

        <p>I am really passionate about building things into a living, breathing reality. I'm not the best
            at it now, but as I continue to grow, I can't wait to see where this profession takes me. As they
            say back home, I'm stoked to learn more!
        </p>
